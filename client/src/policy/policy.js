                    <p>We collect user information such as names, emails, phone numbers, and login credentials to authenticate access. Our system gathers sensor data including water temperature, pH levels, turbidity, and total dissolved solids (TDS) in real-time. Additionally, we log user interactions within the platform to improve usability and performance.</p>
